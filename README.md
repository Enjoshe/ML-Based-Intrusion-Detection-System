# ML-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to detect anomalous and malicious network behavior.  
The objective is to build an intelligent IDS capable of identifying suspicious traffic patterns in real time.

## Features
- Preprocessing of network traffic datasets (NSL-KDD, CICIDS)
- Supervised and unsupervised models (Random Forest, Isolation Forest, etc.)
- Detection of DoS, Probe, U2R, and R2L attacks
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Modular pipeline for experimentation

## Tech Stack
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Optional: TensorFlow or PyTorch

## Future Work
- Real-time detection with Kafka + Spark
- Visualization dashboard with Streamlit
- Auto-updating models with online learning

## Status
In progress â€“ baseline ML classifiers under development
