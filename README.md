# ML-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## 🔒 Overview
This project uses **machine learning** to detect anomalous and malicious network behavior.  
The goal is to build an intelligent IDS that can identify suspicious traffic patterns in real-time.

## ✨ Features
- Data preprocessing of network traffic (NSL-KDD, CICIDS datasets)
- Supervised and unsupervised ML models (Random Forest, Isolation Forest, etc.)
- Detection of DoS, Probe, U2R, and R2L attacks
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Modular pipeline for easy experimentation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebooks
- (Optional) TensorFlow / PyTorch for deep learning

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Real-time detection with Kafka + Spark
- Visualization dashboard with Streamlit
- Auto-update model with online learning

## 📌 Status
🚧 In Progress – building baseline ML classifier
